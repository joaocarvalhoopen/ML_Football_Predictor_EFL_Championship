Based on the code of Siraj Raval  [Predicting the Winning Team with Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQhoUuQrOw) , but severally reimplemented because the original had many design errors and was for a different league, it was for the Premier League.

## Pre-requisites:

Install the free Anaconda for Python 3.7

Install XGBoost

## Notes:

In the process developing this Machine Learning Predictor, I read a book on XGBoost so this is also serves as a documentation example for a good use of the lib XGBoost.

I have also developed a predictor for the English Premier League that is 10 to 20% more accurately then this predictor, but the Premier League game results are normally more stable than the ChampionsShips results, and the odds reflect that.

## Last note:

This predictor knows way more about football then I do, and that is kind of nice!

I had lot’s of fun developing these two predictors, although I couldn’t ear any money with them,  I hope that you also have fun playing with this Machine Learning predictors, best regards.
